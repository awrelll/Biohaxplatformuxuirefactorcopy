## Premium Diagnostic Tests

### 🧬 TrueAge Epigenetic Testing

**Measure biological age vs chronological age through DNA methylation**

#### What is Epigenetic Age Testing?
- Analyzes chemical modifications to DNA (methylation patterns)
- More accurate than chronological age for health outcomes
- Tracks aging at cellular level
- Reversible through lifestyle interventions

#### Key Metrics

##### 1. DunedinPACE (Pace of Aging)
- **What it measures:** Rate of biological aging per calendar year
- **Optimal:** <1.0 (aging slower than chronological time)
- **Average:** 1.0 (aging at normal rate)
- **Concerning:** >1.2 (aging faster than normal)
- **Use case:** Track aging acceleration/deceleration over time

##### 2. Biological Age
- **What it measures:** Overall cellular age
- **Goal:** Be younger biologically than chronologically
- **Example:** 35-year-old with biological age of 28

##### 3. Organ-Specific Aging
- **Brain age** - Cognitive decline risk
- **Heart age** - Cardiovascular risk
- **Liver age** - Metabolic health
- **Immune age** - Immunosenescence
- **Hormone age** - Endocrine function

##### 4. Telomere Length
- **What it measures:** Protective caps on chromosomes
- **Significance:** Shorter telomeres = increased aging
- **Modifiable:** Exercise, stress management, nutrition can lengthen

##### 5. Immune Cell Composition
- T-cell percentages

### 🦠 Geneva GI Effects Test

**Comprehensive gut health diagnostics for microbiome optimization**

#### What Does It Test?
Advanced stool analysis using:
- **PCR (DNA-based detection)** - Identifies microbes by genetic signature
- **Culture** - Grows bacteria to measure quantities
- **Microscopy** - Visually identifies parasites and yeast

#### Five Pillars of Gut Health

##### 1. Maldigestion
**Tests digestive capacity and nutrient absorption**

Biomarkers:
- **Elastase** - Pancreatic enzyme production
- **Fat absorption** - Steatocrit (fat in stool)
- **Protein digestion** - Undigested muscle fibers
- **Carbohydrate digestion** - pH and fermentation markers

Implications:
- Low elastase → Pancreatic insufficiency → enzyme supplementation
- High fat in stool → Bile acid deficiency → ox bile support
- Undigested protein → Low stomach acid → HCl supplementation

##### 2. Inflammation
**Measures intestinal immune activation**

Biomarkers:
- **Calprotectin** - Neutrophil activation (IBD marker)
- **Lactoferrin** - Intestinal inflammation
- **Secretory IgA** - Mucosal immunity
- **Eosinophil Protein X** - Allergic inflammation

Implications:
- High calprotectin → Inflammatory bowel disease → anti-inflammatory protocol
- Low sIgA → Weak gut barrier → immunoglobulins + glutamine
- High EPX → Food sensitivities → elimination diet

##### 3. Dysbiosis
**Analyzes microbial balance and diversity**

Measured:
- **Beneficial bacteria:**
  - Lactobacillus spp.
  - Bifidobacterium spp.
  - Akkermansia muciniphila
  - Faecalibacterium prausnitzii
  
- **Pathogenic bacteria:**
  - C. difficile
  - E. coli (pathogenic strains)
  - Klebsiella
  - Pseudomonas
  
- **Commensal bacteria:**
  - Bacteroides
  - Firmicutes
  - Diversity index

Implications:
- Low beneficial → Probiotic supplementation
- High pathogens → Antimicrobial herbs or Rx
- Low diversity → Prebiotic fiber protocol

##### 4. Metabolite Imbalance
**Measures microbial byproducts**

Biomarkers:
- **Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs):**
  - Butyrate - Colon cell fuel
  - Acetate - Metabolic health
  - Propionate - Glucose regulation
- **pH** - Fermentation health
- **Beta-glucuronidase** - Estrogen metabolism

Implications:
- Low butyrate → Resistant starch supplementation
- Low SCFAs overall → Increase fiber intake
- High beta-glucuronidase → Estrogen dominance risk → calcium-d-glucarate

##### 5. Infections
**Detects parasites, yeast, and H. pylori**

Tests for:
- **Parasites:**
  - Giardia lamblia
  - Entamoeba histolytica
  - Blastocystis hominis
  - Cryptosporidium
  
- **Yeast:**
  - Candida albicans
  - Candida tropicalis
  - Saccharomyces cerevisiae
  
- **H. pylori:**
  - Presence/absence
  - Strain typing
  - Virulence factors (CagA, VacA)

Implications:
